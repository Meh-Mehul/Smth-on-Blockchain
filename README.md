# Smth-on-Blockchain
Simple NFT Maker App which puts your hand-drawn master-peices to Chain. (Just kidding its a fun app for casual chain testing)

## Note

1. This is a sample project and NOT meant to be deployed on an actual chain, i have tested and deployed on the sepolia testNet only, and tested till my ETH ran out
2. I could not test all the features, but i have written tests for them, they are currently passing with high latency
3. Next step might be to optimize this for consuming lesser gas or even store the supposed NFTs in an IPFS itself.
